# Monitoring Setup with OpenTelemetry

This project demonstrates how to set up and monitor a Flask web application using OpenTelemetry, Docker, and Jaeger. This project consists of a Flask web server that exposes health check endpoints and a Requests-Script, which does requests against the web server. The server is instrumented with OpenTelemetry for tracing, and Jaeger is used to visualize the traces. The application is deployed within Docker containers, and Docker Compose is used to orchestrate containers.

# Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following tools installed:

1. Python 3  
2. Docker
3. Docker Compose   
   
# Build and Start the Application  
1. Run the following command to build and start the Docker containers:  
   docker-compose up --build  

3. Run the Monitoring Script  
   Once the containers are up and running, execute the Python monitoring script to check the server status:  
   python3 requests_server.py  

4. Access the Services  
   - Web Application: The Flask app runs on http://localhost:8000  
   - Jaeger UI: Access Jaeger at http://localhost:16686  

5. View Traces in Jaeger  
   - Open the Jaeger UI in your browser.  
   - In the "Search" section, select the service name `web-app` from the dropdown menu.  
   - You will see the traces generated by the Flask application.
